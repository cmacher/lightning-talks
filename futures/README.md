## Presentation
The Lightning Talk presentation uses https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.

## Code
To demonstrate Scala Futures I have used examples borrowed from Daniel Westheide's excellent blog
http://danielwestheide.com/blog/2013/01/09/the-neophytes-guide-to-scala-part-8-welcome-to-the-future.html. He has written a 16 part blog series about various Scala topics which is also available as e-book and which I can highly recommend (https://leanpub.com/theneophytesguidetoscala).
